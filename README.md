Contact Form with client-side validation and LocalStorage saving.

## Local Storage Demonstration
This contact form uses JavaScript Local Storage to save user submissions.

- Open `contact.html` → fill in the form → click "Send Message"
- Then open `submission.html` to view saved entries
- All submissions are stored in your browser’s local storage (key: "Contacts")
